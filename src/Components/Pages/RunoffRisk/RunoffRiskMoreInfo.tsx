          <TextSection>The {styledSpan('New York State Runoff Risk Forecast')} is a decision support tool that can be used by turfgrass managers to determine the best time to apply chemicals. The model uses National Weather Service forecasts for precipitation, temperature, soil moisture, snow cover and landscape characteristics to provide information about potential runoff risk in your area for the next 10 days. The forecasts are intended to be used in addition to other sources of information, and alongside the user&apos;s local knowledge and experience. Together, this information can be used to keep applications on target, increasing productivity and decreasing the risk of local water contamination.</TextSection>
          <TextSection>The intention of this tool is not to estimate specifically how much runoff will occur, but rather the severity level of runoff risk based on environmental conditions and site-specific information. These risk levels are presented as color-coded categories on all maps, tables and charts. For each category, we provide interpretation guidance below.</TextSection>
          <ul style={{ padding: '0px 45px', listStyle: 'disc outside' }}>
            <li><TextSection style={{ textIndent: 0 }}>{styledSpan('LITTLE/NO RUNOFF EXPECTED (NRE):', { color: runoffRiskLegendInfo[0].color })} Little or no runoff is forecasted for your local area.</TextSection></li>
            <li><TextSection style={{ textIndent: 0 }}>{styledSpan('LOW RISK:', { color: runoffRiskLegendInfo[1].color })} Minor risk of a runoff event is forecasted for your local area. This minor event is expected to be less intense than at least 50% of the runoff events typically experienced during this time of year.</TextSection></li>
            <li><TextSection style={{ textIndent: 0 }}>{styledSpan('MODERATE RISK:', { color: runoffRiskLegendInfo[2].color })} The risk of a runoff event is moderate, and expected to be more intense than at least 50% of the runoff events typically experienced during this time of year. Use this information along with other factors to determine application.</TextSection></li>
            <li><TextSection style={{ textIndent: 0 }}>{styledSpan('HIGH RISK:', { color: runoffRiskLegendInfo[3].color })} The risk of a runoff event is high, and expected to be more intense than at least 90% of the runoff events typically experienced during this time of year. Use this information along with other factors to determine application.</TextSection></li>
          </ul>
          <TextSection>These forecasts are intended to be used as one tool during decision making. When the risk is Moderate or High for the area, it is recommended that the applicator closely evaluate the situation at the field level to determine if there are other locations or later dates when the application could take place.‚Äù</TextSection>

          <Typography sx={{ textAlign: 'left' }}variant='h5'>About the models and data</Typography>
          <TextSection>Runoff risk forecasts are generated from a model that incorporates a modification of the <a href="https://www.nws.noaa.gov/ohd/hrl/hsmb/docs/hydrology/PBE_SAC-SMA/NOAA_Technical_Report_NWS_53.pdf">Sacremento Soil Moisture Accounting Heat Transfer Component (SAC-HT) for Enhanced Evaporation</a>. The SAC-HT model incorporates weather observations from numerous sources, including data from weather stations and remote estimates from radar and satellite. These observations provide the model with &qout;current conditions&qout; of air temperature, soil temperature, soil moisture, snow cover, and recently received precipitation.</TextSection>
          <TextSection>Once current conditions are established, the model runs into the future to create the 10-day forecasts. The model is driven by National Weather Service forecasts for precipitation, temperature, snowfall, etc, to generate forecasts of runoff.</TextSection>
